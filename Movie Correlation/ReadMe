---OUTLINE---

This project utilizes Python in Jupyter Notebooks to analyze a movie dataset from Kaggle and determine correlations between variables in the data. The dataset can be found using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies

In this code I will examine the data, clean any missing/duplicated values, change incorrect datatypes, and finally create correlation graphs/heat maps to determine which variables directly influence each other. From there I will make conclusions based off of my initial findings.

---CODE COMMENTS---

In this section I will go code chunk by code chunk explaining what each chunk of code in Jupyter Notebooks does in this program, each chunk will be denoted by a C followed by a number. For example, the third chunk of code will be: C3.

C1:

C2:

C3:

C4:

C5:

C6:

C7:

C8:

C9:

C10:

C11:
